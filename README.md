# ninjaStar
The ninja star activity used for team building exercises. Origami Ninja Stars not included.

You can view it (http://cloong.ceredin.com/ninjastar.html)[here].

I found a creative way of doing a team building exercise. I folded several origami paper ninja stars, and made this webpage which randomises different "getting to know you" questions.

Pick a ninja star, any ninja star.
Click the button to display a random set of questions. 
Take turns answering a question that correlelates to one of the colours on your ninja star.
